Since you can't fork your own repos directly on github, here's how this fork was created, generally speaking:

1. create https://<span></span>github.com/userName/New_Repo on github
2. git clone https://<span></span>github.com/userName/Repo New_Repo
3. cd New_Repo
4. git remote set-url origin https://<span></span>github.com/userName/New_Repo
5. git remote add upstream https://<span></span>github.com/userName/Repo
6. git push origin master
7. git push --all
